## Oracle API Platform Virtual Workshop Labs

This set of labs covers the following Oracle Services –
- Apiary – for API Design
- API Platform CS – for API Management


The use case is very simple – we need to be able to expose an API that allows us to create new organizations, we will start from the design of that API in the first part and in second part look into management of that API on exposure side.


### API Platform (API Design)

Apiary is the de facto tool for designing APIs. At this stage you should have been given access to Apiary.
